    Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. Built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it efficient and suitable for handling real-time applications and APIs. It’s often used in building scalable network applications, like chat apps and streaming services. With npm (Node Package Manager), developers have access to a vast ecosystem of open-source packages. Node.js is lightweight and fast, making it ideal for microservices and RESTful APIs. It bridges the gap between front-end and back-end development, enabling full-stack JavaScript development.
