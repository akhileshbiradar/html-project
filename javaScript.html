    JavaScript is a powerful, high-level programming language used primarily to add interactivity to web pages. It allows developers to create dynamic content like sliders, modals, form validation, real-time updates, and API communication. JavaScript runs directly in the browser, making it essential for front-end development. With the introduction of frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue, JavaScript's role has expanded significantly. Additionally, thanks to Node.js, JavaScript can now be used on the server side too. JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web and is supported by all modern browsers, making it indispensable for web developers.
