    Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end framework developed by Twitter. It provides pre-designed templates and components like buttons, navigation bars, forms, modals, and carousels, which help developers create responsive and visually consistent web pages quickly. It is built on top of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and includes its own grid system and utility classes for layout and spacing. Bootstrap significantly reduces development time and ensures mobile responsiveness across devices. Its latest version, Bootstrap 5, has dropped jQuery dependency, making it more lightweight. Bootstrap is widely adopted in web projects due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
