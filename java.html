    Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language known for its portability, security, and performance. It's widely used in enterprise-level applications, Android development, and backend web services. Java runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows compiled Java code to run on any platform. Features like multithreading, robust memory management, and extensive libraries make it suitable for building scalable, high-performance applications. In web development, Java is often used with frameworks like Spring Boot for building RESTful APIs and microservices. Javaâ€™s strong community support and vast ecosystem make it one of the most reliable and in-demand programming languages.
