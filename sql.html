    SQL is a domain-specific language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows developers to perform operations such as querying data, inserting records, updating entries, and deleting rows. SQL supports functions like filtering, sorting, joining tables, and aggregating data, which are essential for backend and data-driven applications. Common relational database management systems (RDBMS) using SQL include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. Knowing SQL is critical for anyone working with structured data. It is especially important in applications where data integrity, relationships, and complex queries are a primary concern, such as financial systems and CRMs.
