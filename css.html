    CSS is used to style and layout HTML elements. It controls the appearance of web pages, including colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, and responsiveness. CSS3 introduced advanced features like flexbox, grid layout, animations, and transitions, which allow developers to create visually appealing websites without relying on JavaScript. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), developers can maintain cleaner and more manageable code. CSS can be written inline, internally within HTML files, or externally in separate files. Mastery of CSS is crucial for front-end developers, especially when aiming for cross-browser compatibility and mobile-friendly, responsive designs.
