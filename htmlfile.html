    HTML is the backbone of all websites. It defines the structure and layout of a web page using elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. Every website you visit is built using HTML at its core. HTML5, the latest version, introduces new semantic elements as well as multimedia support .HTML alone does not handle styling or functionality; it's usually paired with CSS and JavaScript. As the foundation of web development, learning HTML is essential for anyone interested in building or maintaining websites and web applications.
