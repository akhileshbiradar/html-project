MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB does not require predefined schemas, making it ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. It’s widely used in modern web applications due to its scalability, high performance, and ease of use. MongoDB is well-suited for applications with rapidly changing data structures, such as content management systems, analytics platforms, and IoT. It integrates well with Node.js and other JavaScript-based technologies, forming the "M" in the MERN and MEAN stacks. MongoDB’s document-oriented model enables fast development and easy scalability across distributed systems.
