    Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, offering built-in features like authentication, ORM, admin interface, and form handling. Django adheres to the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, making it easier to develop scalable and secure web applications. With Django, developers can focus more on writing application logic instead of reinventing the wheel. It's known for its robust security features and is widely used by tech giants and startups. Django is ideal for building anything from simple websites to complex, enterprise-grade web platforms with ease.
