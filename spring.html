    Spring Boot is a Java-based framework used to build production-grade, stand-alone, and scalable web applications with minimal configuration. It simplifies the development process by eliminating boilerplate code and offering embedded servers like Tomcat or Jetty. Spring Boot builds on the Spring Framework, providing features like dependency injection, security, REST APIs, and data persistence through Spring Data JPA. It's ideal for microservices architecture due to its modular design and ease of deployment. Spring Boot integrates seamlessly with tools like Maven, Gradle, and Docker, making it a top choice for backend development in enterprise environments and cloud-native applications.
